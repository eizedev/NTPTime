Leap Indicator (LI)
-------------------

This is a two-bit code warning of an impending leap second to be inserted/deleted in the last minute of the current day, with bit 0 and bit 1, respectively, coded as follows:

| LI | Value | Meaning                                  |
| -- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 00 | 0     | no warning                               |
| 01 | 1     | last minute has 61 seconds               |
| 10 | 2     | last minute has 59 seconds)              |
| 11 | 3     | alarm condition (clock not synchronized) |

Version Number (VN)
-------------------

This is a three-bit integer indicating the NTP/SNTP version number. The version number is 3 for Version 3 (IPv4 only) and 4 for Version 4 (IPv4, IPv6 and OSI). If necessary to distinguish between IPv4, IPv6 and OSI, the encapsulating context must be inspected.

Mode
----

This is a three-bit integer indicating the mode, with values defined as follows:

| Mode | Meaning                          |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| 0    | reserved                         |
| 1    | symmetric active                 |
| 2    | symmetric passive                |
| 3    | client                           |
| 4    | server                           |
| 5    | broadcast                        |
| 6    | reserved for NTP control message |
| 7    | reserved for private use         |

In unicast and anycast modes, the client sets this field to 3 (client) in the request and the server sets it to 4 (server) in the reply. In multicast mode, the server sets this field to 5(broadcast).

Stratum
-------

This is a eight-bit unsigned integer indicating the stratum level of the local clock, with values defined as follows:

| Stratum | Meaning                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 0       | unspecified or unavailable            |
| 1       | primary reference (e.g., radio clock) |
| 2-15    | secondary reference (via NTP or SNTP) |
| 16-255  | reserved                              |

Poll Interval
-------------

This is an eight-bit signed integer indicating the maximum interval between successive messages, in seconds to the nearest power of two. The values that can appear in this field presently range from 4 (16 s) to 14 (16284 s); however, most applications use only the sub-range 6 (64 s)to 10 (1024 s).

Precision
---------

This is an eight-bit signed integer indicating the precision of the local clock, in seconds to the nearest power of two. The values that normally appear in this field range from -6 formains-frequency clocks to -20 for microsecond clocks found in some workstations.

Root Delay
----------

This is a 32-bit signed fixed-point number indicating the total roundtrip delay to the primary reference source, in seconds with fraction point between bits 15 and 16. Note that this variable can take on both positive and negative values, depending on the relative time and frequency offsets. The values that normally appear in this field range from negative values of a few milliseconds to positive values of several hundred milliseconds.

Root Dispersion
---------------

This is a 32-bit unsigned fixed-point number indicating the nominal error relative to the primary reference source, in seconds with fraction point between bits 15 and 16. The values that normally appear in this field range from 0 to several hundred milliseconds.

Reference Identifier
--------------------

This is a 32-bit bitstring identifying the particular reference source. In the case of NTP Version 3 or Version 4 stratum-0 (unspecified) or stratum-1 (primary) servers, this is a four-character ASCII string, left justified and zero padded to 32 bits. In NTP Version 3 secondary servers, this is the 32-bit IPv4 address of the reference source. In NTP Version 4 secondary servers, this is the low order 32 bits of the latest transmit timestamp of the reference source. NTP primary (stratum 1) servers should set this field to a code identifying the external reference source according to the following list. If the external reference is one of those listed, the associated code should be used. Codes for sources not listed can be contrived as appropriate.

| Code  |   External Reference Source                                                                                 |
